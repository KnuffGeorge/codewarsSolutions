// The medians of a triangle are the segments that unit the vertices with the midpoint of their opposite sides. The three medians of a triangle intersect at the same point, called the barycenter or the centroid. Given a triangle, defined by the cartesian coordinates of its vertices we need to localize its barycenter or centroid.

// The function bar_triang() or barTriang or bar-triang, receives the coordinates of the three vertices A, B and C as three different arguments and outputs the coordinates of the barycenter O in an array [xO, yO]

// This is how our asked function should work: the result of the coordinates should be expressed up to four decimals, (rounded result).

// You know that the coordinates of the barycenter are given by the following formulas.

// For additional information about this important point of a triangle see at: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid)

// Let's see some cases:

// barTriang([4, 6], [12, 4], [10, 10]) ------> [8.6667, 6.6667]

// barTriang([4, 2], [12, 2], [6, 10]) ------> [7.3333, 4.6667]

// The given points form a real or a degenerate triangle but in each case the above formulas can be used.

// Enjoy it and happy coding!!

function barTriang(p1, p2, p3){
    return [+((p1[0] + p2[0] + p3[0]) / 3).toFixed(4), +((p1[1] + p2[1] + p3[1]) / 3).toFixed(4)]
  }


//   You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

// For example:

// Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:
// Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.

// Let's look at another one.
// You are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:
// Your function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.

// Last one:
// You are given the array {20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}
// At index 0 the left side is {}
// The right side is {10,-80,10,10,15,35}
// They both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)
// Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.

// Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.

// Input:
// An integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.

// Output:
// The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.

// Note:
// If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.

function findEvenIndex(arr)
{ let newArr = arr.map((x,i) => arr.slice(0,i).reduce((el,ac) => el + ac, 0) == arr.slice(i+1).reduce((el,ac) => el + ac, 0))
  return newArr.indexOf(true)
