// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

// arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

// arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
    return a.filter(x => !b.includes(x));
  }

//   Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer number of floors. A tower block is represented with "*" character.

// For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:

// [
//   "  *  ",
//   " *** ", 
//   "*****"
// ]

// And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:

// [
//   "     *     ", 
//   "    ***    ", 
//   "   *****   ", 
//   "  *******  ", 
//   " ********* ", 
//   "***********"
// ]

function towerBuilder(nFloors) {
    let tower = []
    let bricks = "*" 
    for (let i = 1; i <= nFloors; i++){
      let spaces = (nFloors - i)
      tower.push(" ".repeat(spaces) + bricks + " ".repeat(spaces))
      bricks += "**"
    }return tower
