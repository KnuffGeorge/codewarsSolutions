// An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

// Example:

//     The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
//     The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
//     Your function should return the int 5.

// If no number was deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int 0.

// Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).

    if (arr.length === mixArr.length){
      return 0

//   Happy Holidays fellow Code Warriors!

// Santa's senior gift organizer Elf developed a way to represent up to 26 gifts by assigning a unique alphabetical character to each gift. After each gift was assigned a character, the gift organizer Elf then joined the characters to form the gift ordering code.

// Santa asked his organizer to order the characters in alphabetical order, but the Elf fell asleep from consuming too much hot chocolate and candy canes! Can you help him out?
// Sort the Gift Code

// Write a function called sortGiftCode/sort_gift_code/SortGiftCode that accepts a string containing up to 26 unique alphabetical characters, and returns a string containing the same characters in alphabetical order.
// Examples (Input -- => Output):

// "abcdef"                      -- => "abcdef"
// "pqksuvy"                     -- => "kpqsuvy"
// "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"  -- => "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

function sortGiftCode(code){
    return [...code].sort().join('');
