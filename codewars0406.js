// When it's spring Japanese cherries blossom, it's called "sakura" and it's admired a lot. The petals start to fall in late April.

// Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.

// Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground from the same branch.

// Notes:

//     The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see the velocity as a constant during its falling.
//     Pay attention to the data types.
//     If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be 0



function sakuraFall(v) {
    return v > 0 ? 400 / v : 0
  }

//   *** No Loops Allowed ***

// You will be given an array (a) and a value (x). All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value, without using a loop.

// Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either. Return true if the array contains the value, false if not. With strings you will need to account for case.
