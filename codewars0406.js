// When it's spring Japanese cherries blossom, it's called "sakura" and it's admired a lot. The petals start to fall in late April.

// Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.

// Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground from the same branch.

// Notes:

//     The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see the velocity as a constant during its falling.
//     Pay attention to the data types.
//     If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be 0



function sakuraFall(v) {
    return v > 0 ? 400 / v : 0
  }

//   *** No Loops Allowed ***

// You will be given an array (a) and a value (x). All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value, without using a loop.

// Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either. Return true if the array contains the value, false if not. With strings you will need to account for case.

//     Your friend advised you to see a new performance in the most popular theater in the city. He knows a lot about art and his advice is usually good, but not this time: the performance turned out to be awfully dull. It's so bad you want to sneak out, which is quite simple, especially since the exit is located right behind your row to the left. All you need to do is climb over your seat and make your way to the exit.

// The main problem is your shyness: you're afraid that you'll end up blocking the view (even if only for a couple of seconds) of all the people who sit behind you and in your column or the columns to your left. To gain some courage, you decide to calculate the number of such people and see if you can possibly make it to the exit without disturbing too many people.

// Given the total number of rows and columns in the theater (nRows and nCols, respectively), and the row and column you're sitting in, return the number of people who sit strictly behind you and in your column or to the left, assuming all seats are occupied.

function seatsInTheater(nCols, nRows, col, row) {
    return (nCols - col + 1) * (nRows - row) 
  }
