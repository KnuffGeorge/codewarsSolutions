// In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?

// At the end of the first year there will be: 
// 1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants

// At the end of the 2nd year there will be: 
// 1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)

// At the end of the 3rd year there will be:
// 1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213

// It will need 3 entire years.

// More generally given parameters:

// p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to surpass)

// the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.

// aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)

// Examples:
// nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15
// nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10

// Note:

// Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.

function nbYear(p0, percent, aug, p) {
    let pop = p0
    let count = 0
    while(pop < p){
      pop = pop + Math.floor(percent/100 * pop) + aug 
      count++
    }
    return count 
}

// You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

// #Examples:

// Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

// Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

// Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

// Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"

// #Input

// A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.

// #Output

// The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

function getMiddle(s)

  let arr = s.split('')

  arr.shift()

// In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.
// Example

// filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
// filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
// filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]

//   In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

// The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

// Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

// You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

// The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.
// Examples:

// s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
// printer_error(s) => "0/14"

// s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
// printer_error(s) => "8/22"

function printerError(s) {
  let errors = s.split('').filter(x => x.charCodeAt(0) > 109).length
  let total = s.length
